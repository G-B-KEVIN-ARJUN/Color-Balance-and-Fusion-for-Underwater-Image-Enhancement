# Color-Balance-and-Fusion-for-Underwater-Image-Enhancement
We introduce an effective technique to enhance the images captured underwater and degraded due to the medium scattering and absorption. In this method two images are derived from a white-balanced version of the single input, and are merged based on a (standard) multiscale fusion algorithm
