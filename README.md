# Color-Balance-and-Fusion-for-Underwater-Image-Enhancement
We introduce an effective technique to enhance the images captured underwater and degraded due to the medium scattering and absorption. In this method two images are derived from a white-balanced version of the single input, and are merged based on a (standard) multiscale fusion algorithm
We have performed the following operations to enhance the under water Image: 

White Balancing of the image  -- To improve the image aspect by removing undesired color castings due t0 various illuminations or medium attenuation properties.

Gamma Correction of the image -- To correct the global contrast because white balanced images tend to appear too bright.

Normalized Unsharp Masking -- To compensate for loss of details in the under and over exposed regions after the gamma corrections.

After performing above operations we  have implemented Naive Fusion Process and Multi-Scale Fusion Process.
